# Steps (aka your task, ideally for small groups, ideally on a shared whiteboard)

*You may first want to copy the word list into a shared whiteboard*

1. Group words that are related into 5 clusters, considered as potential sub-domains
2. Propose a domain name for each cluster
3. Check each cluster/sub-domain has a clear & distinct purpose (or rename accordingly if necessary)

Then discuss & debrief together!
